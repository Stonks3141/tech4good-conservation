  Habitat destruction is a major cause of extinction and endangerment. As people expand into
  previously wild areas, habitats become fragmented. Roads and buildings split up their previously
  continuous ranges, making traveling and migrating much more dangerous. Grandfather Mountain cannot
  build any new roads or buildings for this reason.
