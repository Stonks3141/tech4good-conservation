  One big cause of habitat destruction is building in wild areas. Avoiding
  building new structures in sensitive ecosystems is a good way to do this. The
  other big cause is deforestation. Grandfather Mountain protects the habitats
  of its animals by not starting any new projects or developments that would
  change the mountain. There is a legal agreement in place that allows the
  property to continue to be used as a nature park. Habitat destruction can be
  caused by hikers straying off-trail and damaging sensitive plants. This could
  be reduced by placing rocks or dense vegetation on the side of the trail.
