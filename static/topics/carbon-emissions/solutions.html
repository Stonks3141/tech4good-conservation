  In order to reduce emissions, we have to increase usage of renewable energy
  and electric vehicles. Renewable energy is now cheaper than energy sourced
  from fossil fuels, but adoption in the US is still low. It's not a top issue
  for enough people for politicians to incentivize it, and there is heavy
  lobbying and opposition from fossil fuel companies. There are many ways that
  individuals can help, such as getting solar panels on their roof, a hybrid or
  electric car, or flying less often. Grandfather Mountain is largely
  solar-powered and has several EV charging stations on the mountain.
