  In order to reduce emissions, we have to increase usage of renewable energy and electric vehicles.
  Renewable energy is now cheaper than energy sourced from fossil fuels, but adoption in the US is
  still low. It's not a top issue for enough people for politicians to incentivize it, and there is
  heavy lobbying and opposition from fossil fuel companies. Individuals can still get solar panels
  on their roof or a hybrid or electric car though. Grandfather Mountain can help by installing
  solar panels and EV charging stations on the mountain.
