  Deforestation is a major problem for the climate. It reduces the Earth's capacity to recover from
  the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Amazon rainforest has lost 20% of its area in the
  last 50 years from deforestation. Deforestation is primarily caused by logging and mining
  operations.
