  Deforestation is the clearing of forests. Although it ocurred mainly in Europe in the past, most
  deforestation is now in rainforests. Rainforests were the last forests to become accessible for
  large operations. Slash-and-burn agriculture, mining, and logging are major causes in tropical
  areas. Since trees produce oxygen, it reduces the Earth's capacity to recover from extra carbon
  dioxide in the atmosphere. Deforestation is a huge threat to any plant or animal living in a
  forest. It also contributes to climate change, soil erosion, reduced biodiversity, fewer crops,
  and flooding.
