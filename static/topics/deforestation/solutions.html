  One way to help reduce deforestation is with drones and satellites. Drones can
  fly overhead and search for illegal logging. Satellite imagery can also be
  analyzed for this using an AI. Another technique is acoustic monitoring.
  Microphones are placed in various parts of the forest and alert rangers if
  they hear people or a chainsaw.
